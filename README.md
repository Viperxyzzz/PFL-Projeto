aaaaa

We gon' live it up
We them Hong Kong kids
We don't give a fuck
The whole world better listen up
All you fake kids better run
So everybody put your drank in the sky
We can get high
We can do anything tonight
We gon' live it up
We them Hong Kids
We don't give a fuck
Waking up surrounded by these mountains
Stanley Market out the window always lovin' how it's soundin'
In the city I was founded, thank god I found it
It's my fucking home feeling like I gotta shout it
I get this land and I feel like it just gets me
If you listen to my music y'all should get to know my city
Talk about Europe, y'all are like you lost me
Well I live out in Hong Kong, Asia, the far east
Ayo you've heard of it I know that it be different
But we chilled out here we be sippin' we be piffin'
We ain't trippin' now we getting to the end of the joint
Now we rippin' now we spliffin' if y'all are gettin' my point
Hong Kong kids coming everywhere to find you
Chillin' with my homies in the fuking 8-5-2
Yeah this city is my home
Doing everything you do except in a different time zone
We gon' live it up
We them Hong Kong kids
We don't give a fuck
The whole world better listen up
All you fake kids better run
So everybody put your drank in the sky
We can get high
We can do anything tonight
We gon' live it up
We them Hong Kids
We don't give a fuck
Don't get me wrong about this Hong Kong lifestyle
Going out every night, it can get quite wild
Drinking liquor out the bottle I'ma sip it 'till it's hollow
High as fuck can't even think about tomorrow
Don't get me started on these cigarettes
At the 7 to 711 never get a rest
Smoking in Stanley, then drinking out at Sunny's
Then we going out to Lan Kwai, the hangover is coming
Drunk as fuck, chucking beers up at the park
Then it's Wan Chai Wednesdays staying past dark
South side down the city out to Kowloon
Friday night was crazy, now Saturday night is round two
Shit is dope, just hope this city remembers me
The only thing that you'll take with you is these memories
I'm loving every moment, I'm never gonna slow up
'Cause there's no place that I'd rather grow up
We gon' live it up
We them Hong Kong kids
We don't give a fuck
The whole world better listen up
All you fake kids better run
So everybody put your drank in the sky
We can get high
We can do anything tonight
We gon' live it up
We them Hong Kids
We don't give a fuck
